		<h5><em>Set against the backdrop of the Regency era, the eight close-knit siblings of the prominent and wealthy Bridgerton family – Anthony, Benedict, Colin, Daphne, Eloise, Francesca, Gregory and Hyacinth – navigate London high society in search of love and happiness, surrounded by friends and rivals alike. Each season focuses on a sibling: S1 for Daphne, S2 for Anthony and S3 for Colin, so on and so forth (the series was renewed for a third and fourth season) </em></h5>
